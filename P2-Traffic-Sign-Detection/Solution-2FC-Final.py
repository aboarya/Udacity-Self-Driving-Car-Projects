# ---
# 
# ## Step 1: Dataset Summary & Exploration
# 
# The pickled data is a dictionary with 4 key/value pairs:
# 
# - `'features'` is a 4D array containing raw pixel data of the traffic sign images, (num examples, width, height, channels).
# - `'labels'` is a 2D array containing the label/class id of the traffic sign. The file `signnames.csv` contains id -> name mappings for each id.
# - `'sizes'` is a list containing tuples, (width, height) representing the the original width and height the image.
# - `'coords'` is a list containing tuples, (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing coordinates of a bounding box around the sign in the image. **THESE COORDINATES ASSUME THE ORIGINAL IMAGE. THE PICKLED DATA CONTAINS RESIZED VERSIONS (32 by 32) OF THESE IMAGES**
# 
# Complete the basic data summary below.

# Visualize the German Traffic Signs Dataset using the pickled file(s). This is open ended, suggestions include: plotting traffic sign images, plotting the count of each sign, etc.

# 
# ## Step 2: Design and Test a Model Architecture
# 
# Design and implement a deep learning model that learns to recognize traffic signs. Train and test your model on the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
# 
# There are various aspects to consider when thinking about this problem:
# 
# - Neural network architecture
# - Play around preprocessing techniques (normalization, rgb to grayscale, etc)
# - Number of examples per label (some have more than others).
# - Generate fake data.
# 
# Here is an example of a [published baseline model on this problem](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf). It's not required to be familiar with the approach used in the paper but, it's good practice to try to read papers like these.
# 
# **NOTE:** The LeNet-5 implementation shown in the [classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/601ae704-1035-4287-8b11-e2c2716217ad/concepts/d4aca031-508f-4e0b-b493-e7b706120f81) at the end of the CNN lesson is a solid starting point. You'll have to change the number of classes and possibly the preprocessing, but aside from that it's plug and play!

# ### Question 1 
# 
# _Describe how you preprocessed the data. Why did you choose that technique?_

# **Answer:**
# 
# For preprocessing I explored several options.  
# 
# 1) Using RGB
# 
# Using RGB only yielded a 70% or so validation accuracy
# 
# 2) Using YUV
# 
# Many of the images are very dark.  I converted the images to YUV and brightened the Y channel but using this same model I was only able to get 88% validation accuracy
# 
# 3) Just Grayscaling
# 
# With the above model and just grayscaling I saw the highest validation accuracy of 93%
# 
# All images were of course normalized to reduce computational by dividing each pixel by the value `255`.

# ### Question 2
# 
# _Describe how you set up the training, validation and testing data for your model. **Optional**: If you generated additional data, how did you generate the data? Why did you generate the data? What are the differences in the new dataset (with generated data) from the original dataset?_

# **Answer:**
# 
# Having read LeCuN's paper on this task, I decided to Jitter each image in the dataset to account for potential deformations in the test set.  This improved validation accuracy from 86 to 99%.
# 
# To create the validation set, I used Sklearn to take 30% of the test set for validation.  
# 

# ### Question 3
# 
# _What does your final architecture look like? (Type of model, layers, sizes, connectivity, etc.)  For reference on how to build a deep neural network using TensorFlow, see [Deep Neural Network in TensorFlow
# ](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/b516a270-8600-4f93-a0a3-20dfeabe5da6/concepts/83a3a2a2-a9bd-4b7b-95b0-eb924ab14432) from the classroom._
# 

# ![title](Model.jpg)

# ![title](crossentropy.jpg)

# **Answer:**
# 
# Full Model details are:
# 
# 1) 2 conv layers of 5x5 kernel sizes
# 
# 2) 2x2 max pooling 
# 
# 3) 2 FC layers each 0.5 dropped
# 
# 
# 
# 
#     

# ### Question 4
# 
# _How did you train your model? (Type of optimizer, batch size, epochs, hyperparameters, etc.)_
# 
# 

# **Answer:**
# 
# Optimizer: Adam
# 
# Epochs: Max of 100
# 
# Batch Size: 32
# 

# ### Question 5
# 
# 
# _What approach did you take in coming up with a solution to this problem? It may have been a process of trial and error, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think this is suitable for the current problem._

# **Answer:**
# 
# I began with a trial and error process which is far too involved for a short answer.  After reading the lecture notes for CS231n, the biggest takeaway for me where the forumulas:
# 
# `(W−F+2P)/S+1`
# 
# and
# 
# `P=(F−1)/2`
#  
#  Having understood that ConvNets do not fully connect on each layer and only through the depth dimension, I attempted to balance the width and heigths dimensions through the first convolution with a patch of 3, a filter size of 32, a stride of 2, and 2x2 pooling.
#  
#  This improved my model drastically.  I still had one other implementation issue:  
#  
#  I pieced together this code from multiple google searches.  At one point I had code which took the softmax, then a few lines of code later used softmax_with_logits.  While this gave reasonable accuracy of 94% I knew it couldn't be trusted because the loss was not reasonable.
#  
#  Removing the `sofmax` and only using `sofmax_with_logits` solved this problem and I consistently received higher than `92%` with this model on each subsequent trial.
#  
#  Accuracy on the test set was always above `95.5%`
#  
#  

# ---
# 
# ## Step 3: Test a Model on New Images
# 
# Take several pictures of traffic signs that you find on the web or around you (at least five), and run them through your classifier on your computer to produce example results. The classifier might not recognize some local signs but it could prove interesting nonetheless.
# 
# You may find `signnames.csv` useful as it contains mappings from the class id (integer) to the actual sign name.

# ### Implementation
# 
# Use the code cell (or multiple code cells, if necessary) to implement the first step of your project. Once you have completed your implementation and are satisfied with the results, be sure to thoroughly answer the questions that follow.

    return loss, accuracy, [predictions]



# ### Question 6
# 
# _Choose five candidate images of traffic signs and provide them in the report. Are there any particular qualities of the image(s) that might make classification difficult? It could be helpful to plot the images in the notebook._
# 
# 

# ## Please refer to the above plot of all signs

# **Answer:**
# 
# There are certainly many brightness issues that can affect the classification.  There are also some images that have more than one sign in them, which increases difficulty even more.

# ### Question 7
# 
# _Is your model able to perform equally well on captured pictures when compared to testing on the dataset? The simplest way to do this check the accuracy of the predictions. For example, if the model predicted 1 out of 5 signs correctly, it's 20% accurate._
# 
# _**NOTE:** You could check the accuracy manually by using `signnames.csv` (same directory). This file has a mapping from the class id (0-42) to the corresponding sign name. So, you could take the class id the model outputs, lookup the name in `signnames.csv` and see if it matches the sign from the image._
# 

# **Answer:**

# In[23]:


with tf.Session() as sess:
    saver.restore(sess, '/home/ubuntu/gtsd-final.chkpt')
    print("Model restored.")
    test_loss, test_accuracy, predictions = evaluate_downloaded(X_downloaded, y_downloaded)
    print("Test Accuracy = {:.3f}".format(test_accuracy*100))
    predictions = np.array([item for sublist in predictions for item in sublist])


# ### Question 8
# 
# *Use the model's softmax probabilities to visualize the **certainty** of its predictions, [`tf.nn.top_k`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/nn.html#top_k) could prove helpful here. Which predictions is the model certain of? Uncertain? If the model was incorrect in its initial prediction, does the correct prediction appear in the top k? (k should be 5 at most)*
# 
# `tf.nn.top_k` will return the values and indices (class ids) of the top k predictions. So if k=3, for each sign, it'll return the 3 largest probabilities (out of a possible 43) and the correspoding class ids.
# 
# Take this numpy array as an example:
# 
# ```
# # (5, 6) array
# a = np.array([[ 0.24879643,  0.07032244,  0.12641572,  0.34763842,  0.07893497,

#          0.09155967]])
# ```
# 
# Running it through `sess.run(tf.nn.top_k(tf.constant(a), k=3))` produces:
# 
# ```
# TopKV2(values=array([[ 0.34763842,  0.24879643,  0.12789202],

#        [1, 3, 5],
#        [1, 4, 3]], dtype=int32))
# ```
# 
# Looking just at the first row we get `[ 0.34763842,  0.24879643,  0.12789202]`, you can confirm these are the 3 largest probabilities in `a`. You'll also notice `[3, 0, 5]` are the corresponding indices.
